# Contact Swap

Contact Swap was an Android application that made it quick and easy to exchange your contact information with someone by touching phones. The code has no doubt bitrotted by now.

It is suggested you browse the `docs` folder for details. Specifically the `Final Presentation.pptx` file.

I no longer have all of the source code but it should be retrievable from the *.apk files in the `build` folder with some effort. As time permits I may work to recreate the project.
